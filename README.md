# InsectMobile: landscape-level drivers of flying insect diversity and biomass 
WORK IN PROGRESS
## 
This repository (R project) contains all scripts necessary to run the ecological/statistical analyses from the study "Landscape-level drivers of flying insect diversity and biomass" (Svenningsen et al. XXXX, DOI: [add link]).

The data were collected in June 2018 and 2019 as part of the citizen science project InsectMobile ("Insektmobilen") at the Natural History Museum of Denmark during June 2018 and June 2019.

* **Data**: data (e.g. the proportional land cover and land use data, flying insect biomass, diversity estimates etc. for each buffer zone) used in the analyses is deposited in XX: [add link]

## Description of the sub directories for data processing ##

* **reports**: a step-wise list of scripts (01_, 02_ etc.) used for processing and analysing the data

## Statistical analyses and modelling ##
Landscape-level effects on flying insect diversity and biomass was modelled with linear mixed-effects models at the buffer size with the most pronounced effect size.
